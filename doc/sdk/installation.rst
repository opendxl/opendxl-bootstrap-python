Installation
************

The installation files are located in the ``lib`` directory of the distribution.

Use ``pip`` to automatically install the library:

    .. parsed-literal::

        pip install dxlbootstrap-\ |version|\-py2.py3-none-any.whl

Or with:

    .. parsed-literal::

        pip install dxlbootstrap-\ |version|\.zip

As an alternative (without PIP), unpack the dxlbootstrap-\ |version|\.zip (located in the lib folder) and run the setup
script:

    .. parsed-literal::

        python setup.py install
