Installation
************

This distribution contains a ``lib`` sub-directory that includes the application library files.

Use ``pip`` to automatically install the library:

    .. parsed-literal::

        pip install ${name}-\ |version|\-py2.7-none-any.whl

Or with:

    .. parsed-literal::

        pip install ${name}-\ |version|\.zip

As an alternative (without PIP), unpack the ${name}-\ |version|\.zip (located in the lib folder) and run the setup
script:

    .. parsed-literal::

        python setup.py install
